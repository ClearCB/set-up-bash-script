# Git bash script

This repository is for a class project. It consist on creating a maven project, interacting with git.

## How it works

This script after running it, will ask you the path and the name of the directory you are going to work with. It is important that before you run it, you have the password of your git account ready since if you do not have it set correctly... you will need to introduce it. 

Also to use the maximum "power" of the script, you have to set ready the github repository empty, to link it when necesary. Algo, you have to change all the "personal" information and change everything you need to improve it! 

## Things to improve

The script could be created with functions instead of lineal commands, to make code reusable. Also, it would be interesting to expand this to implement docker or others projects implementations, like an HTML project.

I though to implement an archive creator, to specifiy a file (with their own extension) and their path located, in case you want to create additional files.

I want to create an additional functionality to add the "content" of for example, git ignore file or the pom.xml to install more dependecies to the maven project.

## Conclusion

The idea was to create an usefull script that could be used by myself to class. Since we started to create projects with maven, but due to the little time I had to "develop" it, just made it a little bit less "complet" I wanted.
